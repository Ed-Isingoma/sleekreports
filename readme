***ROUTINE***

Import an access file without formatting, sothat the table has no header. We dont need the header. the document only needs to have one table. then remove the "<FONTstyle=FONT-SIZE:11pt" stuff using Find & Replace. AND remove the <BR> elements. Then copy the buttons (and script-src line) at the bottom from oldCurricMarks or anywhere else. No more need for the old curric printery button. Then copy also the link rel=stylesheet at the top of the document.

Edit the 'End of term 1' and 'Next term begins on' parts

Make sure the order of columns (subject names) as previously done is respected.

in the end of term 2 report, I have removed the div with id 'notif'
